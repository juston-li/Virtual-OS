os.cpp

Contains the main function that calls the Assember and Virtual Machine.

Takes 1 command-line argument as the filename of the program in assembly language 
to run. Then passes the filename to the assembler. After the assembler outputs a 
*.o file contain object code as decimal values of instructions, the load_mem() 
function is called to load the contents of the object file into a vector as our 
main memory. Lastly execute() is called and the Virtual Machine begins running 
the object code.
